# Vega front-end example using GraphQL

This is the example coded during the ETHOnline "Vega 101 for front end devs" session, which can be found on YouTube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fwHg3iZmNk

Use `npm install` in either subdirectory to install dependencies then `npm run dev` to run the hot-reloading dev server.

There are two projects here:

- **ethonline-live**: the simple version we coded live in the session above
- **fancy-tradestream**: a slightly fancier trade streamer that I created for the [Testnet launch event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DynJumPTmW0)
